# Li-Fi Enabled Drunk Driving Detection and Notification System
Enhance road safety with our innovative Li-Fi Drunk Driving Detection System that detects and alerts oncoming drivers about drunk drivers, reducing the risk of accidents caused by impaired driving.

## 📝 Abstract
Drunk driving is a significant cause of road accidents, leading to injuries and fatalities. This project proposes a system that employs an MQ3 alcohol sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and Li-Fi technology to detect drunk driving and alert nearby drivers. The system detects alcohol levels in a driver's breath and uses Li-Fi modulated LED signals to notify oncoming drivers of a drunk driver's presence, contributing to road safety.

## 🚀 Implementation
The system employs an MQ3 alcohol sensor to detect alcohol levels in a driver's breath. If alcohol level surpasses a threshold, an ultrasonic sensor checks for nearby vehicles. If detected, an LED is modulated using Li-Fi technology to signal the presence of a drunk driver. The opposing vehicle's solar panel captures the modulated LED signal, powering an alarm system that alerts the driver with an audible signal.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Integration with smart city infrastructure
- Integration with autonomous driving technology
- Machine learning-based algorithms for predictive analysis
- Real-time communication enhancement
- Integration with law enforcement agencies
- Development of a mobile application for driver alerts
